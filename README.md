# FLOSS Research Bibliography Collection 

A curated collection of bibliographic references on Free/Libre Open Source Software research, organised by topic in flat files. 
Curated by [Jose Teixeira](http://www.jteixeira.eu/) during his doctoral studies on ["Coopetition in an open-source way"](http://www.jteixeira.eu/dissertation/diss.pdf) in Information Systems at the University of Turku, Finland. 
This collection was originally intended for personal use but is now in the public domain to facilitate a more collaborative mapping of the current state of the art in open-source software research, thereby reducing the duplication of efforts among researchers on the topic.

## Format, files and topics.

The references are organised in bibliography database files (.bib files) by topic. 
The following bibliographic flat-file database files follow the BibTeX format. The standard is widely used and supported by reference management software (e.g., JabRef, Mendeley, Zotero, Google Scholar). 

- [**floss.bib**](floss.bib) - General FLOSS research. Special issues are annotated. Top journals in Software Engineering, Information Systems, Management and Innovation Studies are widely covered.

## Relational Social Network Analysis based on all the bibliographic collection .bib files
### Network Visualization

<!-- With custom size -->
[<img src="coauthorship_coauthorship_network.png" alt="Network" width="50%;">](coauthorship_coauthorship_network.png)

See [coauthorship_coauthorship_report.md](https://github.com/jaateixeira/FLOSS-research-bibliography-collection/blob/main/coauthorship_coauthorship_report.md) for a bibliometric report from a network perspective (i.e. more interested in relations than quantities). 

## Motivation 

 Motivations for releasing to the public domain this curated bibliometric collection include: 

| Motivation                                      | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Poor quality of avaiable data**         |  Most of the references exported from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org), [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), [EBSCOhost](https://www.ebsco.com), [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org), [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org) often contain typos and are wrongly capitalized (e.g., missing the title case).|
| **Long-term Archival and Preservation**         | Ensures bibliometric data is preserved, accessible, and usable for future research.           |
| **Stimulate Collaboration Among FLOSS Researchers** | Encourages open collaboration, data sharing, and community-driven curation of bibliometric data.            |
| **Reduction of Duplicate Efforts**               | Minimizes redundant bibliometric data collection and processing across researchers and research groups.                    |
| **Support for Meta-Research**                    | Facilitates large-scale studies on research trends, impact, and open science practices.     |
| **Encouragement of Open Science Practices**     | Promotes FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in research.          |
| **Community Engagement and Feedback**           | Allows for community contributions, corrections, and updates to the dataset. Improved bibliomentric data by peer reivew before merging               |
| **Interdisciplinary Research Support**          | Enables researchers from different fields to access and analyze bibliometric data.           |
| **Historical and Trend Analysis**               | Supports longitudinal studies of research evolution, citation patterns, and collaboration.   |



## Contributing to the project: 
Fork the project, clone, branch and push. See [Contributing to a project by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project). 

Then, if you want to keep this alive and help tp maintain this map of the current state of the art of research in open-source software, send a pull request on GitHub, and it will be merged after testing.  

Knowledge of [BibTool](http://www.gerd-neugebauer.de/software/TeX/BibTool/en/) and [BibTeX Tidy](https://flamingtempura.github.io/bibtex-tidy/index.html) will not hurt. 

Avoid submitting duplicates or incomplete bibliometric entries. 

Process and clean a BibTeX file using `bibtool` with custom resource rules, if you have the skills. 

```sh
bibtool -v -d -k -r bibtoolrsc.rsc -F [in file] -o [out file]
```

You can use the  [**format_all_bib_with_bibtool.sh**](format_all_bib_with_bibtool.sh) small bash script that formats and generate BibTeX keys for all .bib files in the directory using bibtool and the standard [**bibtoolrsc.rsc**](bibtoolrsc.rsc) configurations.
