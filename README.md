# FLOSS Research Bibliography Collection 

A curated collection of bibliographic references on Free/Libre Open Source Software research, organized by topic. 
Curated by [Jose Teixeira](http://www.jteixeira.eu/) during his doctoral studies on ["Coopetition in an open-source way"](http://www.jteixeira.eu/dissertation/diss.pdf) in Information Systems at the University of Turku, Finland. 
They were intended for personal use, but they are now shared with others mapping the current state of the art of research in open-source software. 

## Motivation 

 Motivations for releasing to the public domain this curated bibliometric collection include: 

| Motivation                                      | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Poor quality of avaiable data**         |  Most of the references exported from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org), [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), [EBSCOhost](https://www.ebsco.com), [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org), [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org) often contain typos and are wrongly capitalized (e.g., missing the title case).|
| **Long-term Archival and Preservation**         | Ensures bibliometric data is preserved, accessible, and usable for future research.           |
| **Stimulate Collaboration Among FLOSS Researchers** | Encourages open collaboration, data sharing, and community-driven curation of bibliometric data.            |
| **Reduction of Duplicate Efforts**               | Minimizes redundant bibliometric data collection and processing across researchers and research groups.                    |
| **Support for Meta-Research**                    | Facilitates large-scale studies on research trends, impact, and open science practices.     |
| **Encouragement of Open Science Practices**     | Promotes FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in research.          |
| **Community Engagement and Feedback**           | Allows for community contributions, corrections, and updates to the dataset. Improved bibliomentric data by peer reivew before merging               |
| **Interdisciplinary Research Support**          | Enables researchers from different fields to access and analyze bibliometric data.           |
| **Historical and Trend Analysis**               | Supports longitudinal studies of research evolution, citation patterns, and collaboration.   |



## Format, files and topics.

The references are organized in bibliography database files (.bib files) by topic. 
The follow the BibTeX bibliographic flat-file database file format that is widely used by standard with broad support by reference management software (e.g., JabRed, Mendeley, Zotero, Google Scholar). 

- [**floss.bib**](floss.bib) - General FLOSS research. Special issues are annotated. Top journals in Software Enginnering, Information Systems, Management and Innovation Studies are widely covered.  
  
- [**floss-coordination.bib**](floss-coordination.bib) - Studies of coordination and collaboration in FLOSS. Used on studies of coordination, collaboration and competition in the  [TensorFlow](https://users.aalto.fi/~apolinj2/tensorflowsna/), [Automotive Grade Linuyx](https://users.aalto.fi/~apolinj2/autogradelinuxsna/), OpenStack, Linux, Koha, WebKit software ecosystems by [Jose Teixeira](http://www.jteixeira.eu/). 
- **floss-diversity.bib** - Diversity, Inclusiveness and inclusion in FLOSS communities. 
- **floss-fission.bib** - Forking, slitting, conflic and community shisms in FLOSS comunnities. 
- **floss-gender.bib** - Gender studies in FLOSS. 
- **floss-lis.bib** - Library and Information Science perspectives. Used by by [Jose Teixeira](http://www.jteixeira.eu/) to study the [Koha](https://koha-community.org/) library system. 
- **floss-motivations.bib** - Developer and company motivations for open-sourcing. 
- **floss-peer-review.bib** - Peer review  (aka code reviews) in FLOSS research. 
- **floss-sna.bib** - Social Network Analysis of FLOSS communities. 

## Usage

### Direct Use
Download individual .bib files and use them. 


### With Reference Managers
. **LaTeX**: They were tested by Jose Teixeira using both (1) BibTeX and BibLaTeX, (2) pdfLaTeX and XeLaTeX, (3) Linux and Mac. So it should work for you. 
- **Zotero**: Import .bib files directly
- **Mendeley**: Import .bib files directly
- **JabRef**: Native .bib support

## Contributing
Follow the regular Git path. First clone or fork, the edit, and commit. '

Then if you want to keep this alive and help maintaining this map of the current state of the art of research in open-source software,  Send a pull request on GitHub and I will merge after testing.  
Knowledge of [BibTool](http://www.gerd-neugebauer.de/software/TeX/BibTool/en/) and [BibTeX Tidy](https://flamingtempura.github.io/bibtex-tidy/index.html) will not hurt. Avoid submitting duplicates or incomplete bibliometric entries.
