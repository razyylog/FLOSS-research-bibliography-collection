  abstract	= {The vast majority of literature on coordination in
		  team-based projects has drawn on a conceptual separation
		  between explicit (e.g. plans, feedback) and implicit
		  coordination mechanisms (e.g. mental maps, shared
		  knowledge). This analytic distinction presents some
		  limitations in explaining how coordination is reached in
		  organizations characterized by distributed teams, scarce
		  face to face meetings and fuzzy and changing lines of
		  authority, as in free/libre open source software (FLOSS)
		  development. Analyzing empirical illustrations from two
		  FLOSS projects, we highlight the existence of a peculiar
		  model, stigmergic coordination, which includes aspects of
		  both implicit and explicit mechanisms. The work product
		  itself (implicit) and the characteristics under which it is
		  shared (explicit) play an under-appreciated role in helping
		  software developers manage dependencies as they arise. We
		  develop this argument beyond the existing literature by
		  working with an existing coordination framework,
		  considering the role that the codebase itself might play at
		  each step. We also discuss the features and the practices
		  to support stigmergic coordination in distributed teams, as
		  well as recommendations for future research.}

  abstract	= { To manage work interdependencies, online communities draw
		  on a variety of arm’s length coordination mechanisms
		  offered by information technology platforms and associated
		  practices. However, “unresolved interdependencies”
		  remain that cannot be addressed by such arm’s length
		  mechanisms. These interdependencies reflect, for example,
		  unidentified or emerging knowledge-based dependencies
		  between the community members or unaccounted relationships
		  between ongoing community tasks. At the same time, online
		  communities cannot resort to hierarchical coordination
		  mechanisms such as incentives or command structures to
		  address such interdependencies. So, how do they manage such
		  interdependencies? To address this question, we conduct an
		  exploratory, theory-generating case study involving
		  qualitative and computational analyses of development
		  activities within an open source software community:
		  Rubinius. We analyze the ongoing management of
		  interdependencies within the community and find that
		  unresolved interdependencies are associated with
		  alternatively structured sequences of activities, which we
		  define as routines. In particular, we observe that two
		  distinct classes of interdependencies—development and
		  developer interdependencies—are associated with
		  alternative forms of routine variation. We identify two
		  generalized routine components—direct implementation and
		  knowledge integration, which address these two distinct
		  classes of unresolved interdependencies. In particular,
		  direct implementation deals with development
		  interdependencies within the code that are not already
		  coordinated through modular interfaces, while knowledge
		  integration resolves unaccounted interdependencies between
		  developers. We conclude with implications for research into
		  organizing principles for online communities and note the
		  significance of our findings for the study of coordination
		  in organization studies in general. }

  abstract	= {Governance provides the authoritative framework for
		  coordinating activities in open source development. Prior
		  studies of open source governance have largely focused on
		  its changing nature over time. In this work, we argue that
		  the nature of governance varies across open source
		  communities, and, in its evolution, multiple traces of
		  authority may co-exist. We propose that such multiplicity
		  can be understood by close examination of the authoritative
		  structures embedded in coordination processes. We collected
		  eight years of data on the coordination related to version
		  control of the Linux kernel. Drawing on in-depth
		  qualitative analysis, we investigate how coordination
		  processes with different authoritative structures come
		  together in the governance of open source software. We
		  trace four coordination processes (autocratic clearing,
		  oligarchic recursion, federated self-governance, and
		  meritocratic idea-testing), each grounded in different
		  authoritative structures (autocracy, oligarchy, federation,
		  meritocracy) with their own form of legitimation. We offer
		  a two-fold contribution in this paper. First, we enhance
		  the open source governance literature by advancing a new
		  theoretical perspective in which governance is seen as a
		  configuration of coordination processes. Configurations
		  give complementary support and are a source of tension and
		  renewal. Second, we articulate a view on the conceptual
		  relationship between governance and coordination where
		  these concepts are understood as a duality, both working
		  together to give rise to efficient and dynamic organizing
		  in open source.}
