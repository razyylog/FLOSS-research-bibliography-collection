  abstract	= {Background: As the area of computing has thrived over the
		  years, the participation of women in computing declined.
		  Currently women represent less than 24% of the computing
		  workforce and that number is declining. On the other hand,
		  the ratios of women in Open Source Software (OSS) projects
		  are even lower.Aims: The primary objective of this study is
		  to determine the level of gender diversity among popular
		  OSS projects and identify the presence of gender biases
		  that may discourage females' participation.Method: On this
		  goal, we mined the code review repositories of ten popular
		  OSS projects. We used a semi-automated approach followed by
		  a manual validation to identify the genders of the active
		  contributors.Results: Our results suggest that lack of
		  gender diversity remains an ongoing issue among all the ten
		  projects as each of the projects had less than 10% female
		  developers. However, many of the projects also suffer from
		  lack of inclusion of females to leadership positions.
		  Although none of the projects suggest significant
		  differences between male and female developers in terms of
		  productivity based on three different measures, data from
		  three out of the ten projects indicate technical biases
		  against female developers with lower code acceptance rates
		  as well as delayed feedback during code reviews. However,
		  biases against females are not universal as majority of the
		  projects do not discriminate against females. The two
		  projects with the least ratios of female contributors as
		  core developers showed the most biases against
		  females.Conclusion: Based on our findings, we conclude that
		  promoting and mentoring females to leadership positions may
		  be an effective solution to foster gender diversity.},

  pages		= {26-37},
  abstract	= {As most of the software development organizations are
		  male-dominated, many female developers encounter negative
		  workplace experiences and report feeling like they “do
		  not belong”. Exposures to discriminatory expletives or
		  negative critiques from their male colleagues may further
		  exacerbate those feelings. The primary goal of this study
		  is to identify the differences in expressions of sentiments
		  between male and female developers during various software
		  engineering tasks. On this goal, we mined the code review
		  repositories of six popular open source projects. We used a
		  semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as
		  multiple social networks to identify the gender of a
		  developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and state-of-the-art
		  sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering
		  domain, we classify each communication as negative,
		  positive, or neutral. We also compute the frequencies of
		  sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by each
		  developer. Our results suggest that the likelihood of using
		  sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code
		  reviews varies based on the gender of a developer, as
		  females are significantly less likely to express sentiments
		  than males. Although female developers were more neutral to
		  their male colleagues than to another female, male
		  developers from three out of the six projects were not only
		  writing more frequent negative comments but also
		  withholding positive encouragements from their female
		  counterparts. Our results provide empirical evidence of
		  another factor behind the negative work place experiences
		  encountered by the female developers that may be
		  contributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE
		  industry.},
