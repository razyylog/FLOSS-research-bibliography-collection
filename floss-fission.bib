  abstract	= {The right to fork open source code is at the core of open
		  source licensing. All open source licenses grant the right
		  to fork their code, that is to start a new development
		  effort using an existing code as its base. Thus, code
		  forking represents the single greatest tool available for
		  guaranteeing sustainability in open source software. In
		  addition to bolstering program sustainability, code forking
		  directly affects the governance of open source initiatives.
		  Forking, and even the mere possibility of forking code,
		  affects the governance and sustainability of open source
		  initiatives on three distinct levels: software, community,
		  and ecosystem. On the software level, the right to fork
		  makes planned obsolescence, versioning, vendor lock-in,
		  end-of-support issues, and similar initiatives all but
		  impossible to implement. On the community level, forking
		  impacts both sustainability and governance through the
		  power it grants the community to safeguard against
		  unfavourable actions by corporations or project leaders. On
		  the business-ecosystem level forking can serve as a
		  catalyst for innovation while simultaneously promoting
		  better quality software through natural selection. Thus,
		  forking helps keep open source initiatives relevant and
		  presents opportunities for the development and
		  commercialization of current and abandoned programs.},

		  of the software business. In such a setting, open source
		  software offers excellent opportunities for sustainability.
		  In particular, safeguarding mechanisms against planned
		  obsolescence by any single actor are built into the
		  definition of open source. The most powerful of these
		  mechanisms is the ability to fork the project. In this
		  paper we argue that the possibility to fork serves as the
		  invisible hand of sustainability that ensures that code
		  remains open and that the code that best serves the
		  community lives on. Furthermore, the mere option to fork
		  provides a mechanism for safeguarding against despotic
		  decisions by the project lead, who is thus guided in their
		  actions to consider the best interest of the community.},

  abstract	= {In general it is assumed that a software product evolves
		  within the authoring company or group of developers that
		  develop the project. However, in some cases different
		  groups of developers make the software evolve in different
		  directions, a situation which is commonly known as a fork.
		  In the case of free software, although forking is a
		  practice that is considered as a last resort, it is
		  inherent to the four freedoms. This paper tries to shed
		  some light on the practice of forking. Therefore, we have
		  identified significant forks, several hundreds in total,
		  and have studied them in depth. Among the issues that have
		  been analyzed for each fork is the date when the forking
		  occurred, the reason of the fork, and the outcome of the
		  fork, i.e., if the original or the forking project are
		  still developed. Our investigation shows, among other
		  results, that forks occur in every software domain, that
		  they have become more frequent in recent years, and that
		  very few forks merge with the original project.},
