  abstract	= {As most of the software development organizations are
		  male-dominated, many female developers encounter negative
		  workplace experiences and report feeling like they “do
		  not belong”. Exposures to discriminatory expletives or
		  negative critiques from their male colleagues may further
		  exacerbate those feelings. The primary goal of this study
		  is to identify the differences in expressions of sentiments
		  between male and female developers during various software
		  engineering tasks. On this goal, we mined the code review
		  repositories of six popular open source projects. We used a
		  semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as
		  multiple social networks to identify the gender of a
		  developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and state-of-the-art
		  sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering
		  domain, we classify each communication as negative,
		  positive, or neutral. We also compute the frequencies of
		  sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by each
		  developer. Our results suggest that the likelihood of using
		  sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code
		  reviews varies based on the gender of a developer, as
		  females are significantly less likely to express sentiments
		  than males. Although female developers were more neutral to
		  their male colleagues than to another female, male
		  developers from three out of the six projects were not only
		  writing more frequent negative comments but also
		  withholding positive encouragements from their female
		  counterparts. Our results provide empirical evidence of
		  another factor behind the negative work place experiences
		  encountered by the female developers that may be
		  contributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE
		  industry.},
