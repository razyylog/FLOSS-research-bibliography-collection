  abstract	= {One might argue that the future of knowledge work is
		  manifested in how open-source communities work. Knowledge
		  work, as argued by Drucker (1968); Davenport, Thomas, and
		  Cantrell (2002); and others, is comprised of specialists
		  who collaborate via exchange of know-how and skills to
		  develop products and services. This is exactly what an
		  open-source community does. To this end, in this brief
		  communication we conduct an examination of open-source
		  communities and generate insights on how to augment current
		  knowledge management practices in organizations. The goal
		  is to entice scholars to transform closed knowledge
		  management agendas that exist in organizations to ones that
		  are representative of the open-source revolution.}
