  abstract	= {Many open source projects have long become commercial.
		  This paper shows just how much of open source software
		  development is paid work and how much has remained
		  volunteer work. Using a conservative approach, we find that
		  about 50\% of all open source software development has been
		  paid work for many years now and that many small projects
		  are fully paid for by companies. However, we also find that
		  any non-trivial project balances the amount of paid
		  developer with volunteer work, and we suggest that the
		  ratio of volunteer to paid work can serve as an indicator
		  for the health of open source projects and aid the
		  management of the respective communities.},

  abstract	= {Open source software projects rely on the voluntary
		  efforts of thousands of software developers, yet we know
		  little about why developers choose to participate in this
		  collective development process. This paper inductively
		  derives a framework for understanding participation from
		  the perspective of the individual software developer based
		  on data from two software communities with different
		  governance structures. In both communities, a need for
		  software-related improvements drives initial participation.
		  The majority of participants leave the community once their
		  needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved.
		  For this set of developers, motives evolve over time and
		  participation becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical
		  to the long-term viability of the software code: They take
		  on tasks that might otherwise go undone and work to
		  maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code.
		  Governance structures affect this evolution of motives.
		  Implications for firms interested in implementing hybrid
		  strategies designed to combine the advantages of open
		  source software development with proprietary ownership and
		  control are discussed.},
