		  comments. We evaluated SentiCR using one hundred 10-fold
		  cross-validations of eight supervised learning algorithms.
		  We found a model, trained using the Gradient Boosting Tree

		  the highest mean precision (67.8%), and the highest mean
		  recall (58.4%) in identifying negative review comments.},

		  there is anecdotal evidence that peer code review has other
		  benefits, including: sharing knowledge, sharing expertise,
		  sharing development techniques, and most importantly
		  building accurate peer impressions between the code review
		  participants. To further investigate the presence of these
		  benefits, we surveyed members of popular OSS communities
		  who were involved with peer code review. We used
		  established scales from Psychology, Information science,
		  and Organizational Behavior to create survey questions. We
		  also enforced multiple reliability and validity measures to
		  ensure higher confidence in the survey results. In this
		  paper, we present a subset of the surveys results focused
		  on better understanding four aspects of peer impression
		  formation: trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and
		  friendship. The results indicate that there is indeed a
		  high level of trust, reliability, perception of expertise,
		  and friendship between OSS peers who have participated in
		  code review for a period of time. Because code review
		  involves examining someone else's code, unsurprisingly,
		  peer code review helped most in building a perception of
		  expertise between code review partners.},

		  focuses on studying the developers' participation
		  motivations. One important motivation is an OSS developer's
		  desire to gain good community reputation which is largely
		  based on positive evaluations from his peers. Therefore, to
		  better motivate developers' project participations through
		  their reputation needs, our empirical analysis adopted a
		  social network perspective to study what factors may affect
		  a developer's decision to positively evaluate one other in
		  a large online open source community called Ohloh. The
		  results surprisingly show that a developer's positive
		  evaluation decision does not depend on his evaluatee's
		  level of OSS-related experience, but rather based on 1) his
		  past reputation (i.e. existing number of positive
		  evaluations), 2) their shared affiliations such as mutual
		  acquaintances, as well as 3) their homophily in location
		  (city), nationality, programming language preference, and
		  community status. We then discuss these findings and their
		  implications for inducing more positive evaluations and
		  better reputation management among open source project
		  members. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
		  first research that investigates issues of reputation

  abstract	= {As most of the software development organizations are
		  male-dominated, many female developers encounter negative
		  workplace experiences and report feeling like they “do
		  not belong”. Exposures to discriminatory expletives or
		  negative critiques from their male colleagues may further
		  exacerbate those feelings. The primary goal of this study
		  is to identify the differences in expressions of sentiments
		  between male and female developers during various software
		  engineering tasks. On this goal, we mined the code review
		  repositories of six popular open source projects. We used a
		  semi-automated approach leveraging the name as well as
		  multiple social networks to identify the gender of a
		  developer. Using SentiSE, a customized and state-of-the-art
		  sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering
		  domain, we classify each communication as negative,
		  positive, or neutral. We also compute the frequencies of
		  sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by each
		  developer. Our results suggest that the likelihood of using
		  sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code
		  reviews varies based on the gender of a developer, as
		  females are significantly less likely to express sentiments
		  than males. Although female developers were more neutral to
		  their male colleagues than to another female, male
		  developers from three out of the six projects were not only
		  writing more frequent negative comments but also
		  withholding positive encouragements from their female
		  counterparts. Our results provide empirical evidence of
		  another factor behind the negative work place experiences
		  encountered by the female developers that may be
		  contributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE
		  industry.},
