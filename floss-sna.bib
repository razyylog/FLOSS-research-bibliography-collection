		  However, integrating external and internal sources of

		  how they interact to influence OSS project success. We
		  propose a taxonomy of participant differences (language,
		  role, and contribution) and project differences
		  (development environment and connectedness) and postulate
		  their main and moderating effects on project success. Using
		  a four-year panel data set of 329 SourceForge projects, we
		  show that development environment difference has a
		  curvilinear relationship with success and that
		  connectedness reduces the positive impact of role and
		  contribution diversity on project success. We also show
		  that when development environment difference is moderate,
		  the impact of role diversity is the most positive. We
		  present the implications of these findings for theory and

		  both technical and commercial success, but that those
		  effects are quite complex. We use latent class regression
		  analysis to show that multiple regimes exist and that some
		  of the effects of network embeddedness are positive under
		  some regimes and negative under others. We use project age

		  project repositories and through communication between
		  them. Thus, in principle it may be possible to study those
		  traces to tell which of the observable socio-technical
		  behaviors of developers in these projects are responsible
		  for the forming of persistent links between them. It may
		  also be possible to tell the extent to which links
