		  this paper, we argue that the gift economy is important,

		  organizes relationships between people in a certain way.
		  Open source software development relies on gift giving as a
		  way of getting new ideas and prototypes out into
		  circulation. This also implies that the giver gets power
		  from giving away. This power is used as a way of
		  guaranteeing the quality of the code. We relate this
		  practice to how gifts, in the form of new scientific
		  knowledge, are given to the research community, and how
		  this is done through peer review processes.},

		  hypothesizes the mediating effect of two proximal

  abstract	= { Metaphors, such as the Cathedral and Bazaar, used to
		  describe the organization of FLOSS projects typically place
		  them in sharp contrast to proprietary development by
		  emphasizing FLOSS’s distinctive social and communications
		  structures. But what do we really know about the
		  communication patterns of FLOSS projects? How generalizable
		  are the projects that have been studied? Is there
		  consistency across FLOSS projects? Questioning the
		  assumption of distinctiveness is important because
		  practitioner–advocates from within the FLOSS community
		  rely on features of social structure to describe and
		  account for some of the advantages of FLOSS production.
		  
		  To address this question, we examined 120 project teams
		  from SourceForge, representing a wide range of FLOSS
		  project types, for their communications centralization as
		  revealed in the interactions in the bug tracking system. We
		  found that FLOSS development teams vary widely in their
		  communications centralization, from projects completely
		  centered on one developer to projects that are highly
		  decentralized and exhibit a distributed pattern of
		  conversation between developers and active users.
		  
		  We suggest, therefore, that it is wrong to assume that
		  FLOSS projects are distinguished by a particular social
		  structure merely because they are FLOSS. Our findings
		  suggest that FLOSS projects might have to work hard to
		  achieve the expected development advantages which have been
		  assumed to flow from \"going open.\" In addition, the
		  variation in communications structure across projects means
		  that communications centralization is useful for
		  comparisons between FLOSS teams. We found that larger FLOSS
		  teams tend to have more decentralized communication
		  patterns, a finding that suggests interesting avenues for
		  further research examining, for example, the relationship
		  between communications structure and code modularity.

		  tells the story of how the FLOSSmole project began, where

		  larger FLOSS ecosystem, since changes in FLOSSmole's
		  mission and goals over the years necessarily reflect some
		  of the cultural and technological changes taking place in
		  FLOSS itself. As such, FLOSSmole will continue to face many

		  communities in open source software (OSS). A particular
		  feature of OSS is that important resources are not directly
		  controlled by firms, but partly reside within communities
		  that co-exist with the firms. Despite this, firms
		  explicitly try to utilize the resources within these
		  communities in order to create and appropriate value.
		  Consequently, the relationships that firms have to these
		  communities influence their way of doing business. Based on
		  case studies of Nordic OSS firms, a typology consisting of
		  symbiotic, commensalistic, and parasitic approaches to
		  handle the firm–community relationship is developed.
		  Depending on the chosen approach, firms encounter different
		  managerial issues and also use different operational means
		  of subtle control. While firms relying on a symbiotic
		  approach have greater possibility to influence the
		  community through subtle means of control, they are also
		  confronted with more challenging managerial issues.}

  abstract	= { Peer production phenomena such as open source software
		  (OSS) have been posited as a viable alternative to
		  traditional production models. However, community-based
		  development often falls short of creating software
		  “products” in the sense that consumers understand. Our
		  research identifies an emerging business network archetype
		  in the OSS sector, the open source service network (OSSN),
		  which seeks to address the “productization” challenge.
		  To do so, OSSNs must overcome the problems associated with
		  exchanging resources between firms. We demonstrate that
		  OSSNs overcome exchange problems by primarily relying on
		  social, rather than legal, mechanisms; similar to the OSS
		  communities from which they emerged. This is made possible
		  because OSSNs use IT infrastructures that provide high
		  visibility for primary value-creating activities. The
		  research utilizes a multimethod theory-building approach,
		  deriving a model from extant research, refining the model
		  through qualitative case study analysis, and further
		  refining the model through quantitative analysis of survey
		  data. The paper reveals the manifestation of social
		  mechanisms in OSSNs and how these are used for coordinating
		  and safeguarding exchanges between firms. Specifically, we
		  illustrate the primary importance of a shared macroculture
		  (goals and norms) and collective sanctions for punishing
		  firms who violate these goals/norms. Furthermore, our
		  research highlights the interplay between digital and
		  social networks within OSSNs, demonstrating that the use of
		  social mechanisms is inherently dependent upon the
		  underlying IT infrastructure. }

		  continuously establishing and maintaining connections with

		  and material rules inherent in the open source community.
		  Based on these observations, we create the theory of

		  participants, distinguishes itself from traditional
		  monocentric design in which one corporation controls a

		  essay, based on a brief review of selected work, we show
		  that research in many different fields and disciplines of
		  the social sciences have shed light on the phenomenon. We
		  argue that five characteristics make the phenomenon
		  particularly attractive to examination from various fields
		  and disciplines using a plethora of research methods: (1)
		  impact: open source software has an extensive impact on the
		  economy and society; (2) theoretical tension: the
		  phenomenon deviates sharply from the predictions and
		  explanations of existing theory in different fields; (3)
		  transparency: open source software has offered researchers
		  an unprecedented access to data; (4) communal reflexivity:
		  the community of open source software developers frequently
		  engage in a dialog on its functioning (it also has its own
		  research community); (5) proximity: the innovation process
		  in open source software resembles knowledge production in
		  science (in many instances, open source software is an
		  output of research processes). These five characteristics
		  also promote a transdisciplinary research dialog. Based on
		  the experience of open source software research, we propose
		  that phenomena-driven transdisciplinary research provides
		  an excellent context to promote greater dialog between
		  disciplines and fields. Moreover, we propose that the
		  recent diffusion of the open source software model of
		  innovation to other areas than software calls for new
		  research and that the field of information systems has an
		  important role to play in this future research agenda.}

		  define as routines. In particular, we observe that two
		  distinct classes of interdependencies—development and
		  developer interdependencies—are associated with
		  alternative forms of routine variation. We identify two
		  generalized routine components—direct implementation and
		  knowledge integration, which address these two distinct
		  classes of unresolved interdependencies. In particular,
		  direct implementation deals with development
		  interdependencies within the code that are not already
		  coordinated through modular interfaces, while knowledge

		  Our empirical strategy relies on the specification and

		  presenting a theory-grounded framework for exploring these

		  Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (DTPB) as a basis
		  for the research propositions, with the aim of: (i)
		  developing a framework of empirical factors that influence

		  popularity and survival. Adopting an instrument variable
		  approach, our analysis of projects hosted on GitHub
		  confirms the significance of both the ideological shifts

		  status motivations but negatively related to their
		  use-value motivations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no
		  evidence of diminished intrinsic motivation in the presence
		  of extrinsic motivations; rather, status motivations
		  enhance intrinsic motivations. Second, we find that

		  different ways. Developers’ paid participation and status
		  motivations lead to above-average contribution levels, but
		  use-value motivations lead to below-average contribution
		  levels, and intrinsic motivations do not significantly

		  control of the Linux kernel. Drawing on in-depth
		  qualitative analysis, we investigate how coordination
		  processes with different authoritative structures come
		  together in the governance of open source software. We
		  trace four coordination processes (autocratic clearing,
		  oligarchic recursion, federated self-governance, and
		  meritocratic idea-testing), each grounded in different
		  authoritative structures (autocracy, oligarchy, federation,
		  meritocracy) with their own form of legitimation. We offer
		  a two-fold contribution in this paper. First, we enhance
		  the open source governance literature by advancing a new
		  theoretical perspective in which governance is seen as a
		  configuration of coordination processes. Configurations
		  give complementary support and are a source of tension and
		  renewal. Second, we articulate a view on the conceptual
		  relationship between governance and coordination where
		  these concepts are understood as a duality, both working
		  together to give rise to efficient and dynamic organizing
		  in open source.}

		  and predict how the newcomers' involvement and environment
		  in the issue tracking system (ITS) affect their odds of
		  becoming an LTC. Method: ITS data of Mozilla and Gnome,
		  literature, interviews, and online documents were used to
		  design measures of involvement and environment. A logistic
		  regression model was used to explain and predict
		  contributor's odds of becoming an LTC. We also reproduced
		  the results on new data provided by Mozilla. Results: We
		  constructed nine measures of involvement and environment
		  based on events recorded in an ITS. Macro-climate is the
		  overall project environment while micro-climate is
		  person-specific and varies among the participants.
		  Newcomers who are able to get at least one issue reported
		  in the first month to be fixed, doubled their odds of
		  becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project
		  popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from
		  peers reduced the odds. The precision of LTC prediction was

  abstract	= {This paper presents a psychological contract perspective
		  on the use of the open source development model as a global
		  sourcing strategy-opensourcing, as we term it here-whereby
		  commerical companies and open source communities
		  collaborate on development of software of commercial
		  interest to the company. Building on previous research on
		  information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework
		  for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The
		  first phase of the research concerned qualitative case
		  studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA
		  Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that
		  had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software
		  and sought to grow a global open source community around
		  their product. We followed this with a large-scale survey
		  involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study
		  identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary
		  customer and community obligations that are associated with
		  opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension
		  points on which customer and community perceptions tend to
		  vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are
		  openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and
		  complementariness: The customer and community need to
		  establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in
		  building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study
		  reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of
		  individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial
		  organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises.
		  It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample
		  opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence
		  moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce
		  toward recruitment of developers from a global open source
		  community whose talents have become known as a result of
		  the opensourcing experience.},
